**Scenario Overview**

Building Images with Buildpacks: The Cloud Native Buildpacks Project
In this lesson we learn about the Cloud Native Buildpacks project, which provides a simple though sophisticated approach for building images in a way that can be easily scaled and operationalized. We cover the motivations for the project, its API-based approach, and some of the implementations available in the ecosystem.

Building Images with Buildpacks: pack, Spring Boot, kpack, and Paketo Buildpacks
In this lesson we explore the features and functionality of Cloud Native Buildpacks using three tools (platforms) for building images: the pack CLI, Spring Boot build plugin, and kpack hosted service. We also explore the modularized buildpacks provided by Paketo Buildpacks for building images in a variety of languages.
