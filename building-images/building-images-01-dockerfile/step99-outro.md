That concludes the lesson on Dockerfile. To recap, we learned about the basic structure of a Dockerfile as well as some best practices to keep in mind when authoring Dockerfiles. We also learned about the layered nature of images and how layers can be used as cache to improve build time, including tips on structuring your Dockerfiles to use cache effectively. Finally, you learned a couple of ways to inspect images.
