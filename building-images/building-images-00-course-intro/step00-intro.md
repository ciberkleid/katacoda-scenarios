**Course Overview**

This scenario is part of a course on [Building Images](https://www.katacoda.com/ciberkleid/courses/building-images).

The scenarios in this course can be completed independently and in any order you like. However, the explanations are written based on the assumption that they are being completed in order. Hence, if you skip ahead, you may encounter an explanation that makes a comparison to something covered earlier. However, this will not preclude you from following or completing any scenario.
