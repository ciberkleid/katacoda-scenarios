In this course, you will learn how to use [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) to easily and sustainably build images from source code.

As compared to Dockerfile, Cloud Native Buildpacks provide a higher level of abstraction and make it significantly easier for developers and operators to build images and manage them at scale.

The Cloud Native Buildpacks project was initiated by Pivotal and Heroku in January 2018 and joined the Cloud Native Sandbox in October 2018. The ecosystem is growing and evolving. In this scenario, we'll learn about Cloud Native Buildpacks through the use of `pack`, the original tool for using Cloud Native Buildpacks. Other scenarios in this course cover alternate ways to use Cloud Native Buildpacks.

**After this scenario you will have...**

* Learned **basic concepts** of Cloud Native Buildpacks
* Created an image from an application using the **`pack` CLI**
* Updated the image, taking advantage of buildpack **layering** and **caching**



Let's begin!
