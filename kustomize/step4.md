 * The `configMapGenerator` create `ConfigMap` resources, no surprise, but does so in a way that if the contents of the `ConfigMap` change, resources that reference that `ConfigMap` will be restarted.  In this case we are using the generator that reads key-value pairs from a properties file and will put those key-value pairs into the environment.  Editing a properties file is easier than adding the environment variables into a deployment YAML file.
